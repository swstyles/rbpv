The paths are maintained in Google Docs and once a week are converted to a JSON file which that can be parsed using this app.

*Rock Band 4*
allows players to simulate the playing of music across many different decades and genres using instrument controllers that mimic playing lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. As the fourth main installment in the Rock Band franchise, it was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 6, 2015.

*Paths*
When you play a song in Rock Band 4, you can play one for four parts(Vocals, Guitar, Bass or Drums). Each part has an optimal path to follow in order to obtain the best possible score. Optimal paths are obtained through trial and error. When an optimal path is acheived, it is recorded by a trustee into the main Google Doc.
